<p id="first">Hi, my name is <b><i>Ayana Sears</i></b> and I was born in Brooklyn, New York on April 2nd 1995. I was raised in Decatur GA and I attend the University of Georgia. Well, I'm actually about to graduate Cum Laude with a Bachelor's Degree in Fashion Merchandising from the finest university in the land. It's been a great four years! I've always been intrigued with fashion and creative styling. From the time I was young, I was creating outfits and posing in front of the camera. So I always knew that I was going to end up working in the fashion industry. My true dream is to become a runway model and that's my first goal. After college, I'll be working in New York in Management at Macy's. I plan on staying at Macy's for a year while pursing my dreams of modeling. When my modeling career kicks off, I will focus on that. I have always been an advocate for following your dreams and my positive thinking and mantra has finally paid off. <b><ins>So, keep believing and keep chasing!</b></ins></p>
